MNE-Python: past, present and future

Introduction: what is MNE-Python?
        - What can it do for you?
	  - Sensor level:
	    - Annotate bad data interactively
	    - Maxfilter
	    - ICA to remove EOG and ECG
	    - Epochs with metadata
	    - Plot evokeds:
	      - plot_joint
	      - plot_topomap
	      - plot_topo
	      - plot_fields
	      - time-frequency analysis

	  - Source level:
	    - Coregistration UI
	    - Make BEM models: plot_alignment
	    - Define source space
            - Compute leadfields (https://github.com/mne-tools/dipole-simulator)
	    - Compute inverse:
	      - MNE/MNE-dSPM/MNE-SLoreta/Sparse MNE
	      - LCMV beamformer
	      - DICS beamformer
	      - RAP Music
	      - Dipole fit

	  - Statistics and decoding
	    - Cluster permutation tests
	    - Time generalization
	    - XDAWN

	  - Simulate data
	  
	- Getting started:
	  - overhauled tutorials
	  - tons of examples
	  - detailed API documentation

Notable features added since last OHBM:
	- Continuous HPI tracking
	- Automatic bad channel detection
	- Automatically estimate MRI fiducials. In some cases, coregistration can be done completely automatic!
	- Our topomap plots are looking better then ever. We've overhauled how the sensor locations are arranged around the head.
	- Compute source power directly from a covariance matrix.
	- Plot sensor level connectivity in 3D
	- Speed improvements across the codebase
	- We support more file formats then ever. Including Curry files and the new NYU 2019 Kit system and reading ICA decompositions from EEGLAB.
	- One more thing...
	  - Pyvista backend
	  - New brain viz
