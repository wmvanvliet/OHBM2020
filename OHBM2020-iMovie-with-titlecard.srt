00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:10,847
Hello OHBM 2020 Open Science Room!

2
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,036
I'm here with an update on the
MNE-Python project

3
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:21,591
MNE-Python is an advanced analysis package
for time series neuroimaging data

4
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:27,600
such as MEG, EEG, ECoG and fNIRS.

5
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:31,956
Whatever your needs are for
pre-processing your data

6
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:35,222
chances are good that MNE-Python can do it.

7
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:41,101
Let's take a look at some of the things it can do...

8
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:43,954
We can annotate bad channels

9
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,523
bad segments

10
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:53,989
bad epochs

11
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:04,885
and MNE-Python now contains a complete
implementation of MEG-IN's maxfilter.

12
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:10,777
You can compute independent components

13
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:13,587
so you can get rid of eye and heart artifacts

14
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:17,987
cut epochs

15
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:22,027
annotate them with meta-data

16
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:24,894
and study evoked activity

17
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,515
Any. Way. You. Like.

18
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:34,025
And when it's time to localize
the actual sources in the brain...

19
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:39,333
Perform co-registration between
your sensors and an MRI scan.

20
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:43,448
Construct BEM models.

21
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:46,262
Define a source space.

22
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:50,102
And compute the lead field.

23
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:53,272
And when it comes to the
actual source localization...

24
00:02:58,002 --> 00:03:03,384
There are so many ways to do it!

25
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:08,731
Use cluster permutation testing
for group level statistics.

26
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,926
And so much more!

27
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,063
Now, let's take a look at what we've been adding

28
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:20,703
since last we saw each other at OHBM.

29
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:23,383
We've implemented the missing pieces

30
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:26,332
to make our open source maxfilter implementation

31
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:29,317
just as good as the commercial MEG-IN version

32
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:33,933
And this means we now support
continuous head position tracking

33
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,933
and correct for it.

34
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:43,791
You can use maxfilter for automatic
bad channel detection of your MEG data.

35
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:48,131
Our co-registration GUI
has gotten some love as well.

36
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:52,734
It will now attempt to automatically detect
the MRI fiducials.

37
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:55,284
It doesn't always work,
but when it does

38
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:59,102
your co-registration can be performed
completely automatic.

39
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:03,526
Our topomap plots are looking better then ever.

40
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:08,718
We've overhauled how we detect the head position
and deal with subsets of sensors.

41
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:10,189
And speaking of sensors...

42
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:13,815
You can now visualize
sensor-to-sensor connectivity in 3D.

43
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:17,270
We also support more file formats than ever.

44
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:19,182
Including: Curry files...

45
00:04:19,182 --> 00:04:22,432
The new NYU 2019 KIT system...

46
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:26,806
And we can import independent components
straight from EEGLAB.

47
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:28,690
We're also faster than ever

48
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:32,038
with speed improvements all over the code base.

49
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:35,211
And finally... there's one more thing...

50
00:04:41,877 --> 00:04:47,041
A completely new visualizer for source activity,
based on PyVista!

51
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:51,892
You can scroll smoothly through time

52
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:56,051
or just press the spacebar to play it as a movie.

53
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:59,783
You can quickly adjust color thresholds.

54
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:06,497
And click on any vertex
to get a plot of the time course.

55
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:18,129
But MNE-Python is more than
just a fantastic piece of software.

56
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:21,721
Above all, we are a community of scientists

57
00:05:21,932 --> 00:05:25,721
sharing our expertise,
so that every one of us benefits.

58
00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:29,628
Every time we solve a problem,
or find a better way to do things

59
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,636
all of our analysis pipelines improve a little.

60
00:05:32,745 --> 00:05:37,441
Our GitHub page is always buzzing
with issues and pull requests.

61
00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:40,555
Come take a look
and see what we're working on next!

62
00:05:40,648 --> 00:05:42,930
Even better: please join in!

63
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:48,514
We encourage everyone to file new bug reports
and contibute pull requests with new features.

64
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:51,792
Alex and Eric are usually
the first ones to respond.

65
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:54,228
Become a contributer to MNE-Python

66
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,099
and you will improve your programming skills

67
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:57,460
you will make new friends

68
00:05:57,485 --> 00:06:01,004
and you will find that when you put in some effort
to help other people

69
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:03,968
others will gladly put in effort to help you.

70
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:08,318
You don't have to solve every problem by yourself.

71
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:10,544
Come join us!
